### *project description*
*This project consist in a chat that uses realtime with socketIO, the idea is
that the people who can't speak (special people) might
comunicate the ideas in a classroom or any social
enviroment using this webapp*.
  
*Includeme is a webapp which is focus in help to comunicate
throught text and voice, the special people only will can 
write and the another people will can use both functions
(talk and write); this project wants keep a pleasant and
fluid conversation.*

*We know how hard is learn a sign language, even another 
language spoked is hard you just supose learn a sign language 
and get have a fluid conversation using sign language, 
how many months did  practice you?*

*Is awesome learn another communication ways, but it's expensive
and bored; if you are a university's teacher and anyday have
a special student in your class, not this is not possible 
beacuse these special people can't study in a university yet
because they aren't yet taken in a account by the society.*
